# Python-Flask-api
API developed using python and flask.
It's a bit crude but works. With afront end it would be fully functional. A website may be coming later to make it fully functional.

Modules used:
  Flask
  MySQL
  JSON
  
 Functional Routes:
  /employees
  /employees_from_id/<id>
  /employees_from_department/<department>
  /employees_from_address/<address>
  /department/<id>
  /position/<id>
  /id/<name>
  /address/<id>
  
  *The post methods are yet to be functional online. They're inly functional on command line
  
  A MySQL database name "employees" with the columns "name", "id", "departement", "position", "address"
  
  *I am aware of the typos in the program
